                Hello, I'm Bikram Paudel. I'm a full-time student at University of Central Oklahoma(UCO). I'm currently living in Edmond, Oklahoma that is where my college is. By the way, I'm senior student.
                So, I might not be here in Edmond next year. 
                </p>
                <p>I guess you're here because you want to know a bit about me, huh? I'm not all that good at talking 
                 about myself, but I'll give it a shot. I came to UCO in Fall of 2014. I spend most of my time in campus. In free time, I
                love to watch movies, the sci-fi ones and horror. Again, YouTube is great for all sorts of stuff. I don't know why I just started talking 
                about YouTube all of sudden. I was supposed to talk about me. Anyway, YouTube is great. That's just a truth.
                I also like to teach myself because there're so many things I don't know. It makes me sad that I don't know about so many things.
                Well, accordig to one of my very few friends, I'm very good in making friends. I've keen interest in Astronomy. Well, who doesn't like
                stars. But if you've any good articles or videos related to stars, space and galaxy, I would like to buy them. Yes, I'm serious. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know I did a terrible job in talking about myself. And I'm pretty sure that I made some grammatical errors or misspelled some of the words while talking about me. I would say please ignore them errors if you could
                    or you could tell me where I made mistake and I'll try to correct them. I completely forgot to talk about my family. I'm going to do that right now. I'm the youngest in my family and they love me. Well, I love them too.
